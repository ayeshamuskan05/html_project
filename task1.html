    <h1><center><b>Introduction to Python language</b></center></h1><hr >
    <h2><b><u>What is a Language?</u></b></h2>
    <h2><b><u>1.What is a Programming language</u></b></h2>
    <p>1. A programming language is a formal system of instructions used to communicate with a
computer. <br>
2. Enables developers to write programs for various tasks such as web development, data
analysis, and automation.<br>
3. Examples: C, Java, Python, JavaScript.

    </p><hr>
    <h2><b><u>2.Why Python?</u></b></h2>
    <p>1. Ease of Use: Simple syntax, ideal for beginners.<br>
2. Versatility: Supports multiple programming paradigms (object-oriented, procedural,
functional).<br>
3. Extensive Libraries: Rich ecosystem for tasks like data analysis, machine learning, and web
development.<br>
4. Community Support: Large and active community for troubleshooting and learning.
</p><hr>
<h2><b><u> 3.What is Python </u></b></h2>
<p>1. Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and
readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and first released in 1991.
Python emphasizes code readability and supports multiple programming paradigms, including
object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming.</p><hr>
<h2><b><u>4.Where Python is Used?</u></b></h2>
<p>1. Web Development: Frameworks: Django, Flask.<br>
2. Data Science and Machine Learning: Predictive modeling and data analysis using NumPy,
Pandas, TensorFlow, scikit-learn.<br>
3. Automation (Scripting): Automating repetitive tasks.<br>
4. Game Development: Framework: PyGame.<br>
5. Scientific Computing: Libraries: SciPy, Matplotlib</p>
<h2><b><u>5.Companies using Python?</u></b></h2>
<p>Google, Netflix, Instagram, Spotify, Dropbox, NASA, Uber, Reddit, IBM,
10000 coders dashboard</p>
   <hr>
   <h2><b><u>6.Disadvantages of Python?</u></b></h2> <hr>
   <p> 1. Slower Execution Speed:<br>
○ Interpreted language, making it slower than compiled languages like C++ or Java<br>
○ Not ideal for performance-critical applications (e.g., real-time systems, gaming
engines).<br>
2. Memory Consumption:<br>
○ Python’s dynamic typing and garbage collection can lead to higher memory usage.<br>
○ Not suitable for applications where memory optimization is crucial.<br>
3. Global Interpreter Lock (GIL):<br>
○ The GIL restricts the execution of multiple threads at the same time.<br>
○ This makes Python less efficient for multithreaded applications, especially on multi-core
processors.<br>
4. Runtime Errors:<br>
○ Python’s dynamic nature allows runtime errors to occur if code is not thoroughly tested.<br>
○ This can lead to bugs in production if not handled properly</p>
<hr>
<h2><b><u>7.Types of Numeric Data types?</u></b></h2>
<p>a. int: Integer values (whole numbers).<br>
b. float: Floating-point numbers (decimal values).<br>
c. complex: Numbers with real and imaginary parts.<br>
d. bool: Boolean values (True or False). </p>
<h2><u><b>8.Purpose of Control Statements in python?</b></u></h2>
<hr>
<p>1. Decision-making: Decide which path of code to execute (e.g., if-else).<br>
2. Repetition: Repeat tasks (e.g., using loops).<br>
3. Branching: Exit or skip specific parts of code when needed (break, continue).</p>
